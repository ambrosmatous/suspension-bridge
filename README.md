It's a simplified model of the Brooklyn bridge in NYC builded from chairs, strings, carton and skewers.

Firstly, I stretched two strings between chairs, on them I tethered some more (shortest are in the middle, that's so the road is straight). After that, I added skewers and on them I layed the cartoons.
